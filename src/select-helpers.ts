/**
 * Waits for `signal` to abort, resolves with `signal.reason` when it is aborted.

 * When `cancelSignal` is cancelled, promise rejects with `AbortedError`
 * 
 * Any listeners added on both `signal` and `cancelSignal` are
 * always removed by the time the promise is settled - no leaks
 * 
 * Note that this function is curried - `returnOnAbort(signal)(cancelSignal)`
 * instead of `returnOnAbort(signal, cancelSignal)`. This is to encourage cleanup
 * of listeners when using it with {@link select}. Compare:
 * 
 * Listener is removed once {@link select} completes:
 * 
 * ```ts
 * await select({ 
 *  aborted: returnOnAbort(mySignal),
 *  someOtherOp: something,
 * })
 * ```
 * 
 * Listener is not removed until `mySignal` aborts:
 * 
 * ```ts
 * await select({ 
 *  aborted: returnOnAbort(mySignal)(),
 *  someOtherOp: something,
 * })
 * ```
 * 
 * In former we pass `(cancelSignal?: AbortSignal) => Promise<unknown>`, which 
 * allows cancellation via `cancelSignal`. In later we pass `Promise<unknown>`,
 * which cannot be cancelled
